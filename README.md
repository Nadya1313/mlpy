## Machine Learning with Python

This repository contains slides, labs and code examples for using `Python` to implement some **machine learning** related algorithms. Codes run on top of a `Docker` image, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment.

To run the code, you will need to first pull the `Docker` image by running the following command:

```
docker pull abmhamdi/mlpy
```

This may take a while, as it will download and install all necessary dependencies.

### Included Algorithms
The repository includes implementation of the following algorithms:
>1. Linear Regression
>1. Logistic Regression
>1. k-NN
>1. K-MEANS
>1. ANN

### Prerequisites
You will need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Docker website](hub.docker.com).
