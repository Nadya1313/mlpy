# PYML
The repository contains the Dockerfile I use to create an image where students can run the labs of Machine Learning. I opted for `Python` as the main programming language, and for `Jupyter Notebook` as the main development environment. The host OS is `Ubuntu`.

The latest image is built upon every push to this repo. Every update is available at [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) via [abmhamdi/pyml](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/abmhamdi/pyml)
